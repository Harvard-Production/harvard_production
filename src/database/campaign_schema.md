# Campaign Schema for Harvard Production tools

When running large, many part projects over a long period of time, it's useful to be able to break things into pieces and have software to manage job submission and bookkeeping.  To this end, there is a campaign.py script that will handle multiple stages, submissions, etc of a single large job.

Campaigns are, of course, managed in the central database.  This document outlines the schema in the database for managing campaings.
